# dotfiles

Hello, these are my dotfiles for my Terminal setup on WSL2 and Iterm.
My Neovim setup is heavily inspired by @craftzdog.

If you want to see his dotfiles you can find them here: https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public

Here is the Youtube video i watched to setup Neovim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajmK0ZNcM4Q
